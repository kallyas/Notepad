## Development Setup

### Requirements
- Windows 7 or later
- Visual Studio 2017 or later (Community edition is fine)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK

### Building
1. Open `Notepad.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Press `F6` or go to `Build > Build Solution`
3. The executable will be in `Notepad/bin/Debug/` or `Notepad/bin/Release/`

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Visual Basic .NET
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep methods focused and small
- Follow existing indentation (4 spaces)
- Use proper capitalization for VB.NET keywords

#### Example:
```vb
Private Sub SaveFile()
    ' Show save dialog to user
    Using sfd As New SaveFileDialog
        sfd.Filter = "All Files (*.*)|*.*"
        If sfd.ShowDialog() = DialogResult.OK Then
            ' Save file content
            File.WriteAllText(sfd.FileName, RichTextBox1.Text)
        End If
    End Using
End Sub
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
